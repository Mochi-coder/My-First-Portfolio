# Portfolio

## Description

This portfolio will showcase what I have learned in both bootcamp and through self-learning. It will consist of web applications I have deployed so far in bootcamp using recently learned skills such as HTML and CSS. 
By creating this portfolio I have learned more about styling on CSS, using flexboxes and grids, as well as improving my knowledge on HTML. There was a few hiccups trying to align texts but I managed to figure it out in the end. 
As the Front-End Web Developer bootcamp progresses, so will this portfolio.Hopefully, one day, my portfolio will consist of fully functional projects!
